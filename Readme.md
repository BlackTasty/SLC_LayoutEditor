# SLC Layout Editor - Creating cabin layouts with ease 

This editor is a support tool for [SLC (Self Loading Cargo)](https://www.selfloadingcargo.com/), and makes creating and modifying cabin layouts as easy as it gets!
 The editor comes with many useful features such as:
 - **Issue checking**: While editing any layout, the editor makes constant checks against cabin layout restraints, and shows all issues in a convenient list
 - **Autofixing issues**: Some issues like misplaced stairways or duplicate doors can be automatically corrected by the editor itself!
 - **Automating slot configuration**: Let the editor handle setting up slot configs for seats, doors and service points
 - **Crash backups**: In case the editor crashes while you have unsaved changes on a layout, backups are created which can be restored on the next launch
 - **Getting started guide**: If you are new to the editor or you need a refresher, you can use the interactive guide to get into creating awesome layouts with ease!
 - **Cabin templates**: Set up cabin templates to quickly create new layouts for the same aircraft
 - **Undo/Redo system**: Made a mistake while editing your layout? Use either the Undo/Redo buttons in the title bar or Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y to quickly step through your changes
 - **Keybinds upon keybinds**: Most actions you can do in the editor (saving layouts, cancelling dialogs, changing slot types, etc.) have a keybind attached to them. For a full list of keybinds either hit Ctrl+K or go to "Help" > "Show keybinds" 
 - **Multi-selecting slots**: The editor allows you to freely add or remove slots to your selection on a cabin deck, speeding up the realisation of your next cabin layout
 - **In-app updates**: Once you have extracted the files for the editor, you can get future updates via the editor itself!
