Added: "Save as" option added
Added: The sidebar containing the aircraft/layout selection, issue tracker and seat counter is now retractable
Added: A new option to automatically retract the sidebar after loading a layout has been added to the settings
Fixed: Fixed an edge case where naming an aircraft "Templates" would result in the editor treating all layouts for this aircraft as templates
Fixed: The editor would crash when starting it for the first time trying to delete a non-existent folder
Fixed: Changing multiple slots at once won't trigger issue checks for each changed slot anymore, which caused the editor to lock up for a while depending on the amount selected
Fixed: Fixed an issue where a portion of the cabin deck title card was not blurred when a dialog was opened
