Re-enabled: The stairway autofix is working again!
Added: You can now undo and redo actions while editing!
Added: Holding down Shift while scrolling your mouse wheel over your layout will now horizontally scroll if possible
Added: In case the editor crashes while a layout/template with unsaved changes was open, a snapshot is created which can be restored at next startup
Fixed: The "getting started" dialog now remembers when you click "No"
Fixed: Fixed a minor alignment problem with the editor view, when the window was maximized
Fixed: The text for duplicate seats didn't update properly
Fixed: Issue trackers for doors and cockpits showed slots like seats as invalid positioned
Fixed: In case where a layout had missing slots in a column, the editor would crash when loading this layout
Fixed: When you have slots selected and open your settings or the welcome screen, returning to the editor would leave behind artifacts
